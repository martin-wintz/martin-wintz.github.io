                <p>Hi. I’m <strong>Martin Wintz</strong>.</p><p>I’m an artist, teacher, writer, and coder passionate about creating and teaching story-driven illustration, as well as experimenting with and building digital tools as part of my process. My passion is sequential art such as comics and graphic novels — the most comprehensive form of visual storytelling that an artist can manage on their own — as well as the intersection of technology and illustration.</p><p>I started my artistic journey 4 years ago after working as a software engineer for almost a decade, including at Amazon AWS. I am mostly self-taught, but also took courses at <a href="https://www.cgmasteracademy.com/courses/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwlN6wBhCcARIsAKZvD5giajOcKvHw6ZB-dFy86KINRjoyIrlfuxlmI2e4_B5LjSpcteQs5EsaAs8SEALw_wcB">CGMA</a> and studied under the mentorship of renowned Spanish comic illustrator <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mikimontllo/?hl=en">Miki Montllo</a>. I’m currently focused on teaching and experimenting with bringing more technology into my workflow using real-time 3d engines, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence.</p>
