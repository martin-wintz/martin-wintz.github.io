                            expansion time from 6 weeks to just over a week by leveraging internal and AWS infrastructure
                            automation tools (CloudFormation, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline) and increasing test coverage for 20+
                            microservices to meet continuous deployment standards, nearly eliminating developer involvement in

                            events per minute for sorting and search. Provided critical service logic and reviewed the majority
                            of pull requests submitted by other engineers.</li>
                        <li>Demonstrated leadership in on-call follow-up tasks, advocating for the prioritization of automated
                            incident resolution by implementing auto-scaling, additional testing, and retry/redundancy logic,
                            leading to a 30% reduction in weekly on-call tickets.</li>
